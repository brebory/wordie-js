# Projects I'm Playing With

I'm going to create a *simple password* creator here, just for me.

### My goals for this project:

1. Create passwords that are easily remembered or calculated in my head if I forget
2. Maps passwords of size n to passwords of size of [n-2n]
3. Practice using string replacement and regexes
4. Practice writing (python/ruby/javascript ... I don't know which language I'm going to use.)

That's it for now. There'll be more in the future. Some other ideas bouncing around my head include: practice using the twitter REST api, practice jQuery ui, practice CSS/LESS/SASS architecting, create useful components/modules for web design
